don't copy the root folder, the folders should look like: tf/custom/dmhud/ with base, resource, scripts and materials folders inside.
and not like: tf/custom/dmhud/dmhud <- common mistake.
using the minmode will break the hud, please don't report this (thanks miiller)
custom crosshairs are working but I haven't added to hudlayout.
